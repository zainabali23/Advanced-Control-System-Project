# Advanced-Control-System-Project
In this study, we designed and evaluated P, PI, and PID controllers using the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method for the given system represented by the open-loop transfer function â€‹ . The controllers were simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, and their responses to a step input were analyzed to assess their performance.
